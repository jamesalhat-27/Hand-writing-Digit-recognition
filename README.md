# Hand-writing-Digit-recognition
Recognizing handwritten digits or blur images of text  using the MINIST dataset
Handwritten Digit Recognition

Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

Features
- MNIST Dataset: Trained on 60,000 images and tested on 10,000 images
- CNN Architecture: Conv2D layers with filters and kernel size, max pooling layers, flatten layer, and dense layers
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy and loss calculation, confusion matrix visualization

Requirements
- Python: 3.x
- TensorFlow: 2.x
- Keras: 2.x
- NumPy: 1.x
- Matplotlib: 3.x (for visualization)
